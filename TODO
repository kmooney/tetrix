More to do on tetrix server:

[x] make a test where the game plays itself and ends with no input

[x] make a test where the game thread starts, and tranmits its state
    but doesn't start playing until it receives a start signal.
    then it plays itself to game-over
[x] self-play the game
[x] speed/time awareness - now ticks are sent.  no ticks? game doesn't advance.
[x] garbage into board
[x] drop @ 2x-10x speed
[x] add hold
[x] add restore hold, too!
[x] add next shape tests
[x] rotation
[x] succesfully moving the piece - this includes DOWN.  does that actually make sense?
[x] landing a piece (ShapeLocked event)
[x] line completed event
[x] score change event - include the new score.  should score be kept by client?

horizon:

API + first clients
API definition
SDL? web?  if a web client, how to build a server?
multiple instances running simultaneously
