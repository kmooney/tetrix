More to do on tetrix server:

[x] make a test where the game plays itself and ends with no input

[x] make a test where the game thread starts, and tranmits its state
    but doesn't start playing until it receives a start signal.
    then it plays itself to game-over

play the game
speed/time awareness - now ticks are sent.  no ticks? game doesn't advance.
drop @ 2x 10x speed
garbage into board
